# GH Review Comments

Manage GitHub PR review comment threads: list, reply, resolve, unresolve, and create reviews with line-level comments.

## Arguments

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- First positional arg: `owner/repo` (e.g., `kumahq/kuma`) — **required**
- Second positional arg: PR number — **required**
- `--author <login>` — Filter threads by reviewer username
- `--thread-id <id>` — Target a specific thread by GraphQL node ID (`PRRT_...`)
- `--reply <message>` — Reply to matched threads with this message
- `--resolve` — Resolve matched threads (after replying if `--reply` also set)
- `--unresolve` — Unresolve (reopen) matched threads
- `--unresolved-only` — Only show/act on unresolved threads (auto-enabled with `--reply` or `--resolve`)
- `--create-review` — Enter review creation mode (see Phase 3 alternative)

## Actions Overview

| Mode            | Flags                     | Behavior                                                  |
|:----------------|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| List            | (no action flags)         | Display threads with IDs, author, body, resolution status |
| Reply           | `--reply <msg>`           | Reply to matched threads                                  |
| Resolve         | `--resolve`               | Resolve matched threads                                   |
| Reply + Resolve | `--reply <msg> --resolve` | Reply then resolve each thread                            |
| Unresolve       | `--unresolve`             | Reopen resolved threads                                   |
| Create review   | `--create-review`         | Interactively create a review with line-level comments    |

## Scripts

All scripts in `scripts/` are executable and self-documented. Run any with no args for usage.

### `scripts/list-threads.sh`

List review threads with metadata via GraphQL.

```
./scripts/list-threads.sh <owner> <repo> <pr_number> [--author <login>] [--unresolved-only]
```

Output: one JSON line per thread with `thread_id`, `comment_id`, `author`, `body`, `path`, `line`, `is_resolved`, `is_outdated`, `reply_count`.

### `scripts/reply-thread.sh`

Reply to a review thread via REST API.

```
./scripts/reply-thread.sh <owner> <repo> <pr_number> <comment_id> <body>
```

- `comment_id`: integer database ID of the **top-level** comment (from `list-threads.sh` `comment_id` field)
- Handles special characters (apostrophes, backticks, newlines) via JSON encoding

### `scripts/resolve-thread.sh`

Resolve a review thread via GraphQL.

```
./scripts/resolve-thread.sh <thread_id>
```

- `thread_id`: GraphQL node ID (`PRRT_...`) from `list-threads.sh` `thread_id` field

### `scripts/unresolve-thread.sh`

Reopen a resolved review thread via GraphQL.

```
./scripts/unresolve-thread.sh <thread_id>
```

### `scripts/create-review.sh`

Create a PR review with line-level comments via REST API.

```
./scripts/create-review.sh <owner> <repo> <pr_number> <event> <body> [<comments_json>|-]
```

- `event`: `COMMENT`, `APPROVE`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES`
- `comments_json`: JSON array of comment objects, each with `path`, `line`, `body` (and optional `side`, defaults to `RIGHT`)
- Pass `-` as last arg to read comments from stdin

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Parse Arguments

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `owner/repo`, PR number, and flags
2. Split `owner/repo` into separate `OWNER` and `REPO` variables
3. Validate: both `owner/repo` and PR number are required
4. When `--reply` or `--resolve` is set, auto-enable `--unresolved-only`

### Phase 2: List Threads

1. Run `scripts/list-threads.sh` with owner, repo, PR number, and filters (`--author`, `--unresolved-only`)
2. If `--thread-id` is specified, filter output to only that thread
3. Display results to the user in a readable format:
   - Thread ID
   - Author
   - File path and line number
   - Resolution status
   - Body preview (first 80 chars)
   - Reply count

If no action flags are set, stop here.

### Phase 3: Execute Action

For each matched thread, execute the requested action:

**Reply** (`--reply`):

1. Extract `comment_id` from the thread data
2. Run `scripts/reply-thread.sh` with owner, repo, PR number, comment_id, and the reply message
3. Report the created reply URL

**Resolve** (`--resolve`):

1. Extract `thread_id` from the thread data
2. Run `scripts/resolve-thread.sh` with thread_id
3. Report success

**Reply + Resolve** (`--reply` and `--resolve` together):

1. Reply first (as above)
2. Resolve second (as above)
3. Report both results

**Unresolve** (`--unresolve`):

1. Extract `thread_id` from the thread data
2. Run `scripts/unresolve-thread.sh` with thread_id
3. Report success

### Phase 3 (alternative): Create Review

When `--create-review` is specified, skip Phase 2 actions and instead:

1. Ask the user for the review event type (COMMENT, APPROVE, or REQUEST_CHANGES)
2. Ask for the review body text
3. Ask for inline comments — for each comment, collect:
   - File path (validate it exists in the PR diff)
   - Line number
   - Comment body
4. Build the comments JSON array
5. Run `scripts/create-review.sh` with the collected data
6. Report the created review URL

### Phase 4: Verify and Summarize

1. After mutations (reply/resolve/unresolve), re-run `scripts/list-threads.sh` to confirm the operations took effect
2. Compare before/after thread states — flag any threads that failed to change

Report:

- Total threads matched/acted on
- Actions taken (replies sent, threads resolved/unresolved, review created)
- Verification result (all succeeded vs. failures with details)
- Link to the PR on GitHub

## Error Handling

- If a thread operation fails, log the error and continue with remaining threads
- If `--thread-id` matches no thread, report "No matching thread found"
