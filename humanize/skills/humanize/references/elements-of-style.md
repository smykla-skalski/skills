## Use the active voice

The active voice is more direct and vigorous than the passive. AI text defaults to passive constructions that weaken the writing.

> **Before:** A survey of this region was made in 1900.
>
> **After:** This region was surveyed in 1900.

> **Before:** There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.
>
> **After:** Dead leaves covered the ground.

> **Before:** The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired.
>
> **After:** Failing health compelled him to leave college.

Do not chain one passive on another. "Gold was not allowed to be exported" becomes "It was forbidden to export gold."

The passive is fine when the receiver of the action is the topic of the paragraph. "The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today" is correct in a paragraph about those dramatists.

## Put statements in positive form

Make definite assertions. Use "not" for denial or antithesis, never for evasion. AI text hedges with negative phrasing where a direct positive statement works better.

| Negative form                 | Positive form |
|:------------------------------|:--------------|
| He was not very often on time | He usually came late |
| did not remember              | forgot |
| did not pay any attention to  | ignored |
| did not have much confidence in | distrusted |
| not important                 | trifling |

This applies to whole passages too:

> **Before:** The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain long in memory.
>
> **After:** The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.

## Use concrete language

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract. AI text gravitates toward generic abstractions. Counter this by grounding statements in observable details.

| Abstract                                           | Concrete                           |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| A period of unfavorable weather set in              | It rained every day for a week     |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward | He grinned as he pocketed the coin |

The surest way to hold the reader's attention is being specific. When dealing with general principles, give particular instances.

## Omit needless words

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences. This does not mean making all sentences short or avoiding detail - it means making every word tell.

| Wordy                          | Concise         |
|:-------------------------------|:----------------|
| the question as to whether     | whether         |
| there is no doubt but that     | no doubt        |
| used for fuel purposes         | used for fuel   |
| he is a man who                | he              |
| in a hasty manner              | hastily         |
| this is a subject which        | this subject    |
| His story is a strange one.    | His story is strange. |

Revise "the fact that" out of every sentence:

| Expression                       | Replacement     |
|:---------------------------------|:----------------|
| owing to the fact that           | since, because  |
| in spite of the fact that        | though          |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you  |
| I was unaware of the fact that   | I did not know  |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure   |

"Who is" and "which was" are often superfluous:

| Wordy                                                | Concise                              |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| His brother, who is a member of the same firm         | His brother, a member of the same firm |
| Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle             | Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle      |

Combine choppy step-by-step sentences into one:

> **Before (51 words):** Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king.
>
> **After (26 words):** Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place.

## Vary sentence structure

Avoid a succession of loose sentences with two co-ordinate clauses joined by a conjunction. This creates monotony:

> The third concert was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the music. The former showed himself an artist of the first rank, while the latter proved fully deserving of its reputation.

Every sentence follows the same "X happened, and Y happened" pattern. Recast some as simple sentences, some as periodic sentences, some with semicolons. The variety should reflect the actual relationships between ideas, not a mechanical template.

AI text produces this kind of structural monotony frequently. Breaking the pattern is one of the strongest signals of human writing.

## Keep related words together

The position of words in a sentence shows their relationship. Keep together what belongs together.

Subject and verb should not be separated by a clause that can move to the beginning:

| Separated                                      | Together                                       |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description | In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description |

Relative pronouns should follow their antecedent immediately:

| Ambiguous                                      | Clear                                          |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were published in Harper's | He published in Harper's three articles about his adventures in Spain |

Modifiers should sit next to what they modify:

| Misplaced                  | Correct              |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------|
| He only found two mistakes | He found only two mistakes |

## Place emphasis at the end

The end of a sentence is its most prominent position. Put the word or phrase you want to emphasize there.

| Weak ending                                       | Strong ending                                     |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways | Humanity has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude |
| This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness | Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors |

The beginning of a sentence is the second most prominent position. Any element other than the subject becomes emphatic when placed first.

This principle applies equally to sentences within a paragraph and paragraphs within a composition. End paragraphs with your strongest point, not a trailing detail.

## One paragraph, one topic

Each paragraph should cover one topic. Begin with a topic sentence that signals what the paragraph is about. End in a way that reinforces the opening, not with a digression.

AI text often produces paragraphs that drift between topics or end with unrelated observations. When rewriting, check that each paragraph has a clear subject and that the final sentence relates to it.

Single-sentence paragraphs are acceptable as transitions but should not be the norm.

## Needless expressions

Words and phrases that add nothing. Replace or remove.

| Expression        | Problem                              | Fix                        |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| case              | usually redundant ("in many cases")  | rewrite ("many rooms")     |
| character         | wordiness ("acts of a hostile character") | cut ("hostile acts")  |
| factor            | hackneyed ("the great factor in")    | rewrite ("he won by")      |
| feature           | adds nothing ("a feature worthy of mention") | describe the thing  |
| interesting       | lazy intro ("an interesting story")  | just tell the story        |
| nature            | same as character ("of a hostile nature") | cut ("hostile")       |
| along these lines | overworked ("spoke along the same lines") | rewrite ("to the same effect") |
| worth while       | vague approval                       | be specific about the value |
| very              | use sparingly; prefer strong words   | cut or choose a stronger word |
| certainly         | false intensifier, like "very"       | cut                        |
